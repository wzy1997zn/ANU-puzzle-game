comments:
  - It is a funtion which used to test whether the tile is valid to cover the given position.
  - It use boolean funtions to check the tile can place on the board or not.
  - It checks whether the tile entirely on the board, whether the tile overlap others and whether the tile satisfy the challenge respectively.
  - The funtion is good and no error, there are also some comments refer to the funtion which can help me to understand.
