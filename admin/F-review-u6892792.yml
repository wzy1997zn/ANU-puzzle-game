comments:
  - The TileType class use a three dimentional array to store all kind of tiles' origin state
  - and a rotate function, which can make it easy to calculate which exact cells are occupied.
  - Methods and variables are properly named and the program decomposition is appropriate.
  - Comments are good. With these comments I can easily understand what the codes mean.
