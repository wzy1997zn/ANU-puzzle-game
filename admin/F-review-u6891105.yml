comments:
  - The best feature of the codes is that they implemented a function in a small amont of codes.
  - Acturally there is no good comments for helping understand but variables names are easy to understand.
  - The program decomposition is appropriate, one is for choice logic, one is for choice box GUI.
  - Good code style. Names show purpose clearly.
  - I did not find errors, but maybe there should be more challenges.
